# What Is A Register File

According to GPT-4:
> In CPU design, a **register file** is a small, fast storage area made up of a set of registers. Registers are tiny storage locations within the CPU that are used to hold data temporarily.

> The word "file" in "register file" doesn't imply a traditional file as understood in the context of file systems and persistent storage. Instead, **it's used to denote a collection or a group.** In the context of register files, it signifies a set or array of registers that the CPU can access. The terminology harkens back to older practices where physical records and data were grouped into files. In a similar vein, a register file groups a set of registers, providing a structured way for the CPU's instruction set architecture to access and use these registers effectively.
